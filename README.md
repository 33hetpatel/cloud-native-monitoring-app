Key Learnings from the Cloud Native Resource Monitoring Python App on K8s Project:

Developed a monitoring application in Python using Flask and psutil, gaining hands-on experience in Python programming and web application development.

Acquired knowledge of Docker and containerization by creating a Dockerfile, building a Docker image, and running a Python application in a Docker container.

Learned how to leverage AWS services, specifically Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), to store and manage Docker images, including creating an ECR repository and pushing Docker images to ECR.

Gained practical experience with Kubernetes by creating an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster, setting up node groups, and deploying the Python application on Kubernetes.

Demonstrated proficiency in automating cloud infrastructure using Python and the Boto3 library, including creating ECR repositories and interacting with AWS services programmatically.

Developed an understanding of the DevOps principles and practices, such as continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) using Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring efficient and scalable deployment of cloud-native applications.

Acquired knowledge of cloud-native monitoring and observability, including metrics, logging, and performance analysis, using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Kubernetes monitoring features.

Demonstrated skills in infrastructure-as-code (IaC) by using Python to create Kubernetes deployments and services, enabling streamlined and automated deployment and management of containerized applications.

Developed proficiency in working with AWS CLI, Docker, Kubectl, and other essential tools for cloud-native application development and deployment.

Enhanced problem-solving and troubleshooting skills by addressing challenges related to building, deploying, and monitoring cloud-native applications in a distributed and dynamic environment.
